To resolve these uncommon Expo CLI errors, systematically check the following:

1. **Verify Device/Simulator Compatibility:** Ensure your device or simulator meets the minimum requirements defined in `app.json` or `app.config.js`. Specifically check the `ios` and `android` fields for `minSdkVersion` or `supportsTablet` which can cause unexpected issues.
2. **Dependency Resolution:**
    * **Review `package.json`:** Carefully examine your `package.json` file for conflicting dependencies (e.g., incompatible version requirements). Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate dependency trees and identify any inconsistencies.
    * **Clear Cache:** Run `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean` to clear npm or yarn cache to address any potentially corrupted cached packages.
    * **Update Dependencies:** Update your packages using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to ensure you are using the latest compatible versions.
3. **Check Node.js Version:** Ensure that your Node.js version is compatible with Expo CLI. Refer to the official Expo documentation for the recommended Node.js version.
4. **Environment Variables:** Review any environment variables used by your project, ensuring they are correctly configured. Some errors are sensitive to incorrect environment settings.
5. **Expo CLI Updates:** Update your Expo CLI to the latest version using `npm update -g expo-cli` or `yarn global upgrade expo-cli`. An outdated CLI can be a source of unexpected issues.
6. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Make sure your project's Expo SDK version is compatible with the other libraries you're using. Incompatibilities between SDK versions and third-party libraries can lead to build errors or unexpected runtime behaviour.
7. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's build folder or cache. Depending on whether you are using Android Studio or Xcode, these steps may differ. In the simplest case, restarting your device or simulator can resolve some problems.
8. **Search for Specific Error Messages:** When you encounter an error, search online for the specific error message.  This often leads you to solutions or discussions about similar issues others have encountered.
