This error occurs when you are using Expo CLI and you try to run the project on a device or simulator that doesn't meet the minimum requirements specified in your app's `app.json` or `app.config.js` file. For example, you might be trying to run a project that requires iOS 14 on an iPhone running iOS 12.  Another cause is having incorrect or conflicting dependencies in your `package.json` file. This can lead to build errors or runtime crashes.  It could also be due to issues with your development environment, such as incorrect Node.js version, missing dependencies, or corrupted cache.
